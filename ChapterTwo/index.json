And I can't walk without my ankle.\"</p>\n<p>The guard blinked, \"Prosthetics? I'm sorry, but we'll need to do a search. Please follow me.\"</p>\n<p>\"Not necessary.\"</p>\n<p>The guard glanced over his shoulder, \"Ah. Mr. Abraham.\"</p>\n<p>\"She's clear.\"</p>\n<p>The guard nodded and waved a hand, \"Ma'am.\"</p>\n<p>Suzie walked through and frowned, \"Code?\"</p>\n<p>The man smiled, \"7897643C.\"</p>\n<p>She sighed heavily and shrugged, \"Where to?\"</p>\n<p>\"McIntyre Industries is currently the base of operations.\" He waved her to follow and started walking, \"In fact, I'm sorry to say that I don't work for CSIS.\"</p>\n<p>Suzie stopped in her tracks, \"You don't work for any of the Five Eyes. You work for McIntyre.\"</p>\n<p>\"Kind of.\" He said turning, \"My name is Jedidiah Abraham. I'm the current CEO.\"</p>\n<p>\"New Zealand, Australia, Canada, the US or the UK. They are the people I work for.\" She growled, \"The Five Eyes alliance. Not some upstart company with dreams of chaos.\"</p>\n<p>Jedidiah glared at her, \"CSIS put McIntyre in charge. They don't have the experience for this. However, I requested they reach out for an expert. ASIO sent you. You are meant to advise, supervise, and call the shots.\"</p>\n<p>Suzie sighed heavily and started walking, \"What the hell have you guys done?\"</p>\n<p>\"Not here.\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\"Here.\" Jedidiah said, sitting down behind his desk at the CSIS.</p>\n<p>He frowned and pushed a tablet computer across to Suzie, where she stood stiffly, \"It got stolen.\"</p>\n<p>Suzie flicked through the various images, pausing at the technical layout, \"Wait\u2026 This tank drives itself?\"</p>\n<p>\"Low-level artificial intelligence.\" Jedidiah said and smiled, \"The principles of a smart car taken to a new level. It can strategise and so on, both at an individual level and collectively within its unit. However, it's only a prototype.\"</p>\n<p>Suzie tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, \"You built\u2026 A smart tank.\"</p>\n<p>Jedidiah nodded, \"Well, yes. Josiah's exoskeleton could have pointed you in that way already.\"</p>\n<p>\"Do not name that son of a bitch!\" Suzie yelled, fighting tears, and the CEO winced, \"I'm sorry.\"</p>\n<p>She grabbed her face, \"Yeah\u2026 Me too.\"</p>\n<p>She sighed and looked at the display, \"It\u2026 It's kind of functioning already, isn't it?\"</p>\n<p>\"Semi.\"</p>\n<p>Suzie frowned, \"The remote shutdown should be operational. One of the first things you would activate on that thing. So what went wrong?\"</p>\n<p>\"The shutdown protocol connects to a command unit. The prototype command unit wasn't stolen, but it only has a range of a couple hundred kilometres\u2026 And the tank is out of range.\"</p>\n<p>Suzie shook her head, \"That doesn't make sense\u2026 Someone must have jammed the signal.\"</p>\n<p>Jedidiah frowned, \"Any idea how? I suggested that, and my technicians laughed at me.\"</p>\n<p>Suzie flicked through a few screens, searching the schematics, embedding the plans into her memory, \"Weird\u2026 The frequency used for communication is pretty high level stuff. Makes use of some funky science\u2026 Photon conversion to matter amongst other things\u2026 Ah\u2026 Right.\" She smiled, looking at him, \"I can think of six ways to jam the signal. That's pretty impressive.\"</p>\n<p>Jedidiah frowned, \"Impressive that you can come up with them?\"</p>\n<p>\"Impressive that I can only think of six.\" Suzie said and frowned, \"But\u2026 I think that they should all scare you\u2026 If the tank is having its frequency jammed\u2026 Then they have resources that are ridiculous. They'd need equipment enough and expertise enough that they could duplicate the tank, without buying anything, and without hiring anyone.\"</p>\n<p>He winced, \"That\u2026 Would not be a number of people in this world. McIntyre spent six years building the tank. Nearly bankrupted us.\"</p>\n<p>She shrugged, \"Yeah. But it only took you four years to build. The rest has been wasted efforts on the software. Mostly failures.\"</p>\n<p>Jedidiah smiled, \"Never miss a thing, do you?\"</p>\n<p>Suzie's face fell, \"Sometimes I do. Sometimes other people pay for it.\"</p>\n<p>That was when the building twisted sideways.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Sound seemed fuzzy, and the world was blurred.</p>\n<p>Shock.</p>\n<p>The logical side of her head kicked into high gear, pushing Suzie to her feet, despite the vertigo, and the dizziness.</p>\n<p>She analysed the hole, the aftermath of an explosion.</p>\n<p>The shrapnel\u2026</p>\n<p>Bone.</p>\n<p>Suzie winced as sound kicked back into gear, and she heard shouting.</p>\n<p>\"For Ontaro!\"</p>\n<p>She swore and leaped behind the desk, wincing as her hearing went through shellshock again.</p>\n<p>Suicide bombers.</p>\n<p>Holy hell.</p>\n",
