              <p>Suzie's heart was going through the roof.</p>
<p>This was insane.</p>
<p>What the hell was she doing?</p>
<p>… This was about the dumbest thing she had ever done.</p>
<p>She was sitting quietly at a table, in an uncomfortable black dress…</p>
<p>A dress!</p>
<p>… Whilst looking across the table at a kid who looked too big for his suit, wearing an incredibly sheepish expression.</p>
<p>Of course, he wasn't just a kid. His name was Ted, and he was kinda smart for someone her age, which wasn't something Suzie could usually say.</p>
<p>She'd flirted with Ted before Josiah had… Had… She winced.</p>
<p>Ted went into panic mode, "Is everything okay? Is it the restaurant? Don't you like seafood?"</p>
<p>Suzie shook her head, "Forget it. Just memories."</p>
<p>Crapsicles… Is this how crazy romance is? Is everything always this… Awkward?</p>
<p>She smiled sweetly, "Its perfect."</p>
<p>Heat flushed into his cheeks and he shifted uncomfortably in his seat, "That's good."</p>
<p>Suzie sighed heavily and looked around the restaurant, "Exactly how can a high school student afford this?"</p>
<p>Ted smiled sheepishly, "I play a little bit of music now and then. You know, busking."</p>
<p>She glanced back at him, "Not just good at math? Music too?"</p>
<p>He shrugged, "Not that great. I can't write it. Just… Play."</p>
<p>Loosen up already!</p>
<p>Suzie smiled softly, "Still like to hear it sometime… What do you play?"</p>
<p>"A bit of… Uke, guitar… Piano… Sometimes I can be bothered to try violin, but usually that just ends with bloody fingers." Ted spoke shyly, and Suzie blinked, "What kind of music?"</p>
<p>He smiled softly, "Sort of… Jazz stuff."</p>
<p>Suzie grinned, thinking it through, "Experimental… Wait… You like discord don't you?"</p>
<p>He finally smiled openly, "Yeah. Drifting out to other places and so on… Its music without end… But I don't generally perform that kind of stuff… People find it weird."</p>
<p>She shook her head, "Not me. Its… Freedom."</p>
<p>The waiter arrived carrying their plates and lowered it slowly, "Madame, sir."</p>
<hr />
<p>Suzie smiled from her doorstep at the nervous Ted, and kissed his cheek gently, giving him palpitations. "It was a good night. See you later?"</p>
<p>Ted swallowed, "Yeah, sure."</p>
<p>She grinned, "Buck up kid, you have my number, and I have yours."</p>
<p>Ted blinked, "Since when do you have my number?"</p>
<p>Suzie rolled her eyes, "I work for ASIO. I kinda like you. Put it together."</p>
<p>"That's illegal." He glared and then smiled, "And kinda sweet."</p>
<p>Suzie smiled and opened the door, "Sleep tight, Ted."</p>
<p>"You too," he said and turned and walked over to his bike.</p>
<p>She pushed open the door and walked in slowly, breathing in heavily.</p>
<p>"I hope it was a good night."</p>
<p>Pistol appeared in her hand, and Suzie glared at the man standing in her kitchen, "Do you have a death wish, Alistair?"</p>
<p>Her supervisor sighed heavily, "Authentication Code 9-Alpha-Seti."</p>
<p>Suzie sighed and holstered the weapon under her dress, "What the hell do you want?"</p>
<p>Alistair smiled softly, "We have a situation. You are being activated."</p>
<p>She rubbed her face, "Seriously? Right when a guy I actually like isn't a total asshole?"</p>
<p>Her supervisor didn't smile, "Relationships are unwise for someone in your position, Susan."</p>
<p>"My name is Suzie!" She exploded angrily, her fists tightening, and she seethed, "And I am about sick of you. I am sixteen, and you are more than a bit rude."</p>
<p>"I'm not your friend." Alistair growled, "I'm your handler. Get used to being handled."</p>
<p>She ground her teeth together, "Then what am I being handled towards?"</p>
<p>"Transfer. Canada. Authorisation Code 7169B83C." Alistair growled and Suzie breathed out in exasperation.</p>
<p>Transfer to Canadian Security Intelligence Service, explanation once on the soil in Ottawa.</p>
<p>In-bloody-convenient!</p>
<hr />
<p>Suzie: [Sorry Ted! Work is evil. I have to go off the radar for a bit. I swear the date was good, and we'll have another once I'm back in the open.]</p>
<p>Ted: [Oh hell. I hope you stay safe out there.]</p>
<p>Suzie: [You know me.]</p>
<p>Ted: [Yeah. That's why I'm asking you to stay safe. Not do something stupid.]</p>
<p>Suzie: [Lol. Nice. I'll try.]</p>
<p>Ted: [Take care.]</p>
<p>Suzie: [I'll have another kiss for you when I get back.]</p>
