His name was Ted, and he was kinda smart for someone her age, which wasn't something Suzie could usually say.</p>\n<p>She'd flirted with Ted before Josiah had\u2026 Had\u2026 She winced.</p>\n<p>Ted went into panic mode, \"Is everything okay? Is it the restaurant? Don't you like seafood?\"</p>\n<p>Suzie shook her head, \"Forget it. Just memories.\"</p>\n<p>Crapsicles\u2026 Is this how crazy romance is? Is everything always this\u2026 Awkward?</p>\n<p>She smiled sweetly, \"Its perfect.\"</p>\n<p>Heat flushed into his cheeks and he shifted uncomfortably in his seat, \"That's good.\"</p>\n<p>Suzie sighed heavily and looked around the restaurant, \"Exactly how can a high school student afford this?\"</p>\n<p>Ted smiled sheepishly, \"I play a little bit of music now and then. You know, busking.\"</p>\n<p>She glanced back at him, \"Not just good at math? Music too?\"</p>\n<p>He shrugged, \"Not that great. I can't write it. Just\u2026 Play.\"</p>\n<p>Loosen up already!</p>\n<p>Suzie smiled softly, \"Still like to hear it sometime\u2026 What do you play?\"</p>\n<p>\"A bit of\u2026 Uke, guitar\u2026 Piano\u2026 Sometimes I can be bothered to try violin, but usually that just ends with bloody fingers.\" Ted spoke shyly, and Suzie blinked, \"What kind of music?\"</p>\n<p>He smiled softly, \"Sort of\u2026 Jazz stuff.\"</p>\n<p>Suzie grinned, thinking it through, \"Experimental\u2026 Wait\u2026 You like discord don't you?\"</p>\n<p>He finally smiled openly, \"Yeah. Drifting out to other places and so on\u2026 Its music without end\u2026 But I don't generally perform that kind of stuff\u2026 People find it weird.\"</p>\n<p>She shook her head, \"Not me. Its\u2026 Freedom.\"</p>\n<p>The waiter arrived carrying their plates and lowered it slowly, \"Madame, sir.\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Suzie smiled from her doorstep at the nervous Ted, and kissed his cheek gently, giving him palpitations. \"It was a good night. See you later?\"</p>\n<p>Ted swallowed, \"Yeah, sure.\"</p>\n<p>She grinned, \"Buck up kid, you have my number, and I have yours.\"</p>\n<p>Ted blinked, \"Since when do you have my number?\"</p>\n<p>Suzie rolled her eyes, \"I work for ASIO. I kinda like you. Put it together.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's illegal.\" He glared and then smiled, \"And kinda sweet.\"</p>\n<p>Suzie smiled and opened the door, \"Sleep tight, Ted.\"</p>\n<p>\"You too,\" he said and turned and walked over to his bike.</p>\n<p>She pushed open the door and walked in slowly, breathing in heavily.</p>\n<p>\"I hope it was a good night.\"</p>\n<p>Pistol appeared in her hand, and Suzie glared at the man standing in her kitchen, \"Do you have a death wish, Alistair?\"</p>\n<p>Her supervisor sighed heavily, \"Authentication Code 9-Alpha-Seti.\"</p>\n<p>Suzie sighed and holstered the weapon under her dress, \"What the hell do you want?\"</p>\n<p>Alistair smiled softly, \"We have a situation. You are being activated.\"</p>\n<p>She rubbed her face, \"Seriously? Right when a guy I actually like isn't a total asshole?\"</p>\n<p>Her supervisor didn't smile, \"Relationships are unwise for someone in your position, Susan.\"</p>\n<p>\"My name is Suzie!\" She exploded angrily, her fists tightening, and she seethed, \"And I am about sick of you. I am sixteen, and you are more than a bit rude.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm not your friend.\" Alistair growled, \"I'm your handler. Get used to being handled.\"</p>\n<p>She ground her teeth together, \"Then what am I being handled towards?\"</p>\n<p>\"Transfer. Canada. Authorisation Code 7169B83C.\" Alistair growled and Suzie breathed out in exasperation.</p>\n<p>Transfer to Canadian Security Intelligence Service, explanation once on the soil in Ottawa.</p>\n<p>In-bloody-convenient!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Suzie: [Sorry Ted! Work is evil. I have to go off the radar for a bit. I swear the date was good, and we'll have another once I'm back in the open.]</p>\n<p>Ted: [Oh hell. I hope you stay safe out there.]</p>\n<p>Suzie: [You know me.]</p>\n<p>Ted: [Yeah. That's why I'm asking you to stay safe. Not do something stupid.]</p>\n<p>Suzie: [Lol. Nice. I'll try.]</p>\n<p>Ted: [Take care.]</p>\n<p>Suzie: [I'll have another kiss for you when I get back.]</p>\n",
