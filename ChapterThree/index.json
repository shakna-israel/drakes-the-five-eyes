Jedidiah was safe, collapsed behind the desk\u2026 But the inner wall was completely gone. The lobby was covered in scorch marks and\u2026 Other stuff.</p>\n<p>She winced and limped out towards one of the mostly intact\u2026</p>\n<p>Damn.</p>\n<p>Suzie knelt beside the ruins of a human, and glanced over it. The torso was mostly intact, apart from the surface flesh, but there was something burned into its remains. Something that it had likely been carrying, made of metal.</p>\n<p>It was distorted and melted now, but some fractal-based mathematics formed a rough shape in her mind. It was a seal, likely designed to be used as a threat, because it belonged to the smart tank.</p>\n<p>The kind of weapon that fanatics like these would adore.</p>\n<p>She winced, feeling pain in her torso and glanced down, blinking as she saw the tiny hole in her gut, not so much bleeding as pouring a small rivulet of blood down her.</p>\n<p>Suzie stood up, swallowed, and then jammed her fingers into the cut, her eyes rolling in the pain, but she felt the purchase of the tiny object and ripped it out.</p>\n<p>The young agent swallowed back the bile, and dropped the bloody tooth to the ground. She swallowed and ejected a bullet from her gun, using her robotic arm to split the bullet apart, letting the gunpowder fall onto the wound, then she fired off an empty shot with her gun, letting the hammer ignite the powder.</p>\n<p>Bloody hell!</p>\n<p>She un-gritted her teeth and breathed out heavily, the cauterised wound stinging like no tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Suzie frowned and looked back at the melted seal.</p>\n<p>Melted.</p>\n<p>A flash-explosion had managed to melt something made of a very serious metal. That was pretty extreme.</p>\n<p>She grinned, that was hubris.</p>\n<p>The suicide bombers had used a compound that used incredible heat for no reason. It wasn't destructive. It was simply\u2026 Showing off.</p>\n<p>Suzie frowned, not a lot of chemical components could be used to generate such a weapon\u2026 And fewer still could be easily obtained.</p>\n<p>She dug her phone out of her pocket, and then thought better of it and dropped the shattered object to the ground. It's particular resistance to explosions hadn't exactly proved strong.</p>\n<p>Suzie rubbed her face and flipped open a panel on her arm, and hit the touchscreen a few times, and then sighed heavily, \"No WiFi. Should have seen that coming.\"</p>\n<p>How did people find things before the internet?</p>\n<p>She sighed and ran down the stairs, she had to get to somewhere with an internet connection. Had to stop whoever this was, from striking again.</p>\n<p>No one rushed to stop her, she saw more death and destruction on her way out than she had seen in her entire lifetime. How could someone willingly do this to another person?</p>\n<p>How could someone ever wish death on someone else?</p>\n<p>She sprinted down the road, passed bewildered and shellshocked onlookers, and skidded into a shopping centre. She flicked the panel on her arm open again and smiled as it connected. She quickly logged in to her remote access at ASIO, and fired up a search.</p>\n<p>Compounds\u2026</p>\n<p>Canada\u2026</p>\n<p>Explosives\u2026</p>\n<p>Ah.</p>\n<p>Purchasers\u2026</p>\n<p>Backtracing\u2026</p>\n<p>Back orders.</p>\n<p>Shell companies\u2026</p>\n<p>Isn't anyone ever creative anymore? At least make the name a joke, if you aren't going to make it hard to see through!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Jedidiah groaned loudly, wincing as he felt a hand touch his arm, \"Sir, stay calm.\"</p>\n<p>He winced and went to sit up, instantly getting pushed down. \"No sir, lie down.\"</p>\n<p>He swallowed nervously, \"That\u2026 What the hell happened?\"</p>\n<p>\"Let's work on getting you healthy first.\"</p>\n<p>Jedidiah winced, and tapped his ear, \"Wake up, COMMi.\"</p>\n<p>His ear vibrated, generating a voice only he could hear, \"Yes, Jedd?\"</p>\n<p>He sighed heavily, \"Determine cause of action, last hour.\"</p>\n<p>\"Canadian Security Intelligence Services were struck by a series of explosions forty six minutes ago. Cause is not yet publicly determined. Street cameras, though data is corrupted via explosions, suggest suicide bombers.\"</p>\n<p>Jedidiah's entire body tensed, and he swallowed nervously, the paramedic grabbed his wrist, \"Sir?\"</p>\n<p>He waved it off, \"Just talking with my security system. Verify my identity, and you can drop it.\"</p>\n<p>\"I already have, sir.\"</p>\n<p>Jedidiah grinned, and then spoke quietly, \"COMMi\u2026 Give me a target.\"</p>\n<p>\"One target seems to have survived unscathed and exited the building before subsequent explosions. Scanning for facial matches.\"</p>\n<p>He tapped his fingers rhythmically, impatient for the answer, and then his program finally responded, \"Verified. Susan Drakes, operative of ASIO, currently on loan to CSIS.\"</p>\n<p>Jedidiah winced and sat up, ignoring the paramedics protests, \"COMMi, issue a Code 127 to all Five Eyes organisations. Authorise on my behalf.\"</p>\n<p>He stood slowly, ignoring the agony, and turned to the paramedic, \"This is a national emergency. No one is to leave this plaza. Call it, right now.\"</p>\n<p>The man turned to talk to others, but Jedidiah was busy, his eyes scanning the wreckage of the building he was in front of. This much damage\u2026 It was insane.</p>\n<p>It didn't make sense.</p>\n<p>\"COMMi, exactly how many explosions can you detect?\"</p>\n<p>\"Seven. Three followed by a six minute gap, followed by four. Beyond the larger gap, there were no more than sixty seconds between each explosion.\"</p>\n<p>Jedidiah tensed, \"Impossible.\"</p>\n<p>That much destruction\u2026 From that few explosions\u2026 They had to have been super-heated.</p>\n<p>A screech of tires distracted him, and he looked over at the white jeep, the letters 'CSIS' plastered on the side, as it disgorged its contents.</p>\n<p>Two agents, one male and built like a linebacker, the other female and seemingly over-muscled.</p>\n<p>The female spotted him and made a beeline for Jedidiah, whereas the male seemed to survey the crowd as he moved, searching for something.</p>\n<p>\"Sir, Agent Calson.\" She said as she neared, \"What can you tell me about the attack?\"</p>\n<p>\"Not a lot.\" Jedidiah frowned, \"Authorisation Code?\"</p>\n<p>She smiled softly, \"Sorry, sir.\" She patted her pockets and pulled a book out, \"17637B?\"</p>\n<p>Jedidiah rolled his eyes, \"Close enough. It\u2019s the one under that today.\"</p>\n<p>She blushed, \"Sorry sir.\"</p>\n<p>He scratched his head, \"As far as I can tell, there were seven explosions, but after three our expert fled the scene. Possibly to isolate and eliminate the greater threat.\"</p>\n<p>The male spoke softly as he arrived, \"I doubt it\u2026 There was no possible way that she passed her psych evaluation.\"</p>\n<p>Jedidiah smiled, \"So you're a profiler, then? Agent\u2026?\"</p>\n<p>\"Manfred.\"</p>\n<p>Jedidiah sighed and rubbed his face, \"Look, we have practically no information. We just had one of our sites attacked and destroyed. An expert we called in, predicting a situation, is no longer in contact with us. She may have taken some bait and been eliminated. It's what I would try and do. What we know for certain is someone attacked CSIS. They suicide bombed us. Not exactly a defining trait. We need to track whatever made the explosion, or make an assumption whoever took the tank did this. If so, track the tank.\"</p>\n<p>Agent Calson ran a hand through her short blond hair, \"Dangerous to make an assumption, right now.\"</p>\n<p>\"Taskforce.\" Manfred said and smiled, \"Send the CSIS in full-tilt. Three directions.\"</p>\n<p>Jedidiah nodded, \"I've already issued the order. You should receive a SMS shortly detailing who to report to, in this case, me. We will track the explosion, let others step up security and track the tank.\"</p>\n<p>He smiled, \"Calson, get hold of a lab, preferably with a spectrometer. Manfred and I will examine the scene.\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Suzie sat crouched on a rafter, controlling her breathing, watching in the dark warehouse.</p>\n<p>She'd managed to track the chemicals back to a shipping point, but no further, yet.</p>\n<p>It was unlikely anyone intelligent would return to pick up the remaining chemicals\u2026 But small mistakes often took down large organisations.</p>\n<p>Also, someone smart would have booby-trapped the remaining chemicals, and that would lead her towards whoever did it.</p>\n<p>So, she sat crouched in place, waiting and watching. Analysing.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Calson looked at the odd, and slightly mysterious CEO of McIntyre Industries as he stared at a readout, \"I didn't think CEOs studied science.\"</p>\n<p>\"I was an engineer.\" He replied distractedly, \"Never a brilliant person like Josiah or Suzie\u2026 But good enough to read a spectrometer.\"</p>\n<p>He shifted to a computer and tapped away on the keys, and then smiled softly, \"Great.\"</p>\n<p>He turned around, \"Whoever made the explosives used some pretty nasty stuff. Palladium amongst other stuff. Which means we can track them.\"</p>\n<p>Calson smiled and nodded, \"Location?\"</p>\n<p>\"Give me a damn minute.\" He said glaring, \"I only just analysed how to make the bomb!\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Suzie blinked, yawning as the saw a group of men moving towards the container, and she grinned, swinging down on her arm till she hang in the air effortlessly, glaring at them as they approached the container.</p>\n<p>One of the tapped a clipboard against the container, \"This one. Shouldn't exist. Manifest says it was lost at sea.\"</p>\n<p>One of the others shrugged, \"Do we really want to know what is inside a McIntyre container without calling them first? Those guys are crazy.\"</p>\n<p>Suzie's face fell and she dropped to the ground, \"Don't open it!\"</p>\n<p>The guards glanced over at her, and the third laughed, \"What do you know? Bait actually does work.\"</p>\n<p>She swore and dove to the side as three guns appeared and fired in her direction, and she felt the too-familiar scorch of bullets nicking her. Why couldn't she move faster?</p>\n<p>Being only human sucks sometimes. Why couldn't I be a werewolf or something strong like that?</p>\n<p>Suzie sighed and drew her sidearm, swallowing nervously.</p>\n<p>I can't kill. I can't kill. I can't kill.</p>\n<p>She winced, shaking her head.</p>\n<p>Then Suzie flipped, using her ankle, looking at the world upside down, and fired thrice. She landed on her wrist, using it to push herself onto her feet as the guard each hit the ground in pain.</p>\n<p>Suzie reloaded the clip quickly and glared, \"Who exactly do you work for?\"</p>\n<p>One of them, holding his bleeding ankle, glared up at her, \"Who the hell do you think you are?\"</p>\n<p>\"Suzie Drakes, ASIO.\"</p>\n<p>The man burst out laughing, \"Fly to the trap. Holy crap, he was right. You came.\"</p>\n<p>Then she swore as he crushed something in his hand, and the container vanished.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\"Got a ping.\" Calson spoke quickly, and Jedidiah turned, \"Then get to it.\"</p>\n<p>She nodded, \"Explosion in the warehouse district. Agents are enroute.\"</p>\n<p>Jedidiah nodded, \"COMMi, what happened out there?\"</p>\n<p>The CEO nodded slowly, and looked at her seriously, \"Arrange for a prison cell. Suzie Drakes was seen entering the area.\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Head hurts!</p>\n<p>Good god! My head hurts!</p>\n<p>Suzie blinked furiously, the light making the pounding inside her skull seem pleasant at best.</p>\n<p>\"Susan!\" A voice yelled, and she grabbed her ears, \"Holy crap!\"</p>\n<p>Then she stared up at an angry face, and swallowed weakly, \"Sheesh\u2026 Jedidiah\u2026 What the hell?\"</p>\n<p>He glared at her, \"You are implicated in the suicide bombing against the CSIS. You are on probation. Charges are pending. Please tell me that I'm wrong.\"</p>\n<p>Suzie swallowed again, \"I have been bombed\u2026 Twice. McIntyre owned the container. But it was probably fraudulently used.\"</p>\n<p>\"I hope this is simply stupidity.\" He growled angrily, \"You leave, more suicide bombers strike. You are found with the evidence in your hands. You have the expertise and resources to build the bombs. You have motive. And by all accounts, you are psychologically unstable.\"</p>\n<p>Suzie winced, \"Oh. This really doesn't look great for me, does it?\"</p>\n<p>Jedidiah sat down, \"No. So, what do you have to say?\"</p>\n<p>\"Someone's taunting you.\" She frowned, \"I left after spotting a seal from the smart tank melted into\u2026 Into\u2026 Into one of the bodies.\" Suzie winced, trying to focus, trying not to see the faces, \"I figured the chemicals were high grade, and used my ASIO access to track shipments until I found one likely, and traced it. Met three guys, thought they were about to open the container, and innocent. I interrupted and they detonated it. Trap.\"</p>\n<p>Jedidiah sighed, \"Really. Is that why you were alone, looking like you had tried to destroy the evidence?\"</p>\n<p>She winced, \"Oh crap.\"</p>\n<p>He stood up, and went to walk away, \"Yeah.\"</p>\n<p>The door swung closed heavily, and Suzie snapped into action. This would only work one way. She had to get free, track down the asshole and bring them down.</p>\n<p>Suzie turned and fired up her prosthetics to full strength and punched through the wall, wincing at the tremors it sent through her body. She stepped through the hole and ducked as a fist tried to take out her head, she caught the arm and twisted it, sending them flying.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Jedidiah winced and swallowed, \"How the hell did she get out?\"</p>\n<p>\"Mr. Abraham, she's a turncoat.\" Manfred said with a sigh and shrugged, \"The question is, how exactly should she be eliminated?\"</p>\n<p>Jedidiah sighed heavily, \"I guess the best option would be a certain satellite. I'll get my people on it.\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Suzie clenched her fists, \"Get out of my way.\"</p>\n<p>The blond facing her simply laughed and drew two pistols, \"Unlikely. Stand down, Agent Drakes.\"</p>\n<p>\"No.\" Suzie said, her hands flexing, \"I will take you out if I need to. Someone nasty is still out there.\"</p>\n<p>The blond shrugged and fired quickly, causing Suzie to flinch as she fell backwards, searing pain in both her shoulders, \"Holy crap! Is that how you talk to people?\"</p>\n<p>Suzie flexed, \"Back off. You are vexing me, and I am not exactly in a good mood.\"</p>\n<p>\"I am Agent Calson of the CSIS. I request you stand down, or I will be forced to take you in by force.\"</p>\n<p>Suzie laughed, \"Girl\u2026 You know who I am. You really, really should not be messing with me.\"</p>\n<p>Calson raised her guns again, \"Need another taste?\"</p>\n<p>Suzie sneered angrily and flexed her arm, and something shifted inside of it, \"Please, don't make me do this. I've seen\u2026 Enough.\"</p>\n<p>Calson rolled her eyes, and Suzie struck. It was a simple enough manoeuvre, one she'd developed whilst recovering from\u2026 Josiah\u2026 The palm of her hand held a frequency generator, and she fired it.</p>\n<p>The copper inside Calson's weapons shook violently, heating, and the bullets inside the guns fired, including those in the clip, punching through Calson's hands.</p>\n<p>The woman screamed, dropping the weapons, and Suzie flinched as the two that had been in the chamber shot passed her.</p>\n<p>\"I\u2026 Tried to warn you.\"</p>\n<p>Calson glared, \"You can't win, traitor!\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm not the traitor you dumb bimbo!\" Drakes yelled angrily and shook her head, walking towards the entrance, \"I'm bloody hunting them.\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Back to the warehouse.</p>\n<p>It was a no-brainer, really.</p>\n<p>Suzie cringed as she saw the destruction left behind by the explosion, wincing at the thought of yet more people being hurt by her.</p>\n<p>Why did violence follow her around?</p>\n<p>How many people had died because of her?</p>\n<p>She shook her head, trying to avoid nightmares waking up inside her. She didn't need that right now.</p>\n<p>Didn't need any of this damn mess.</p>\n<p>But it was hers.</p>\n<p>Suzie crouched, picking up a handful of the ash, rubbing it in her hands. There had to be something, somewhere in all of this. Some evidence of whoever had stolen the smart tank, attacked the CSIS.</p>\n<p>\"Hey, Suzie.\"</p>\n<p>Chills ran down her spine, and she swallowed, memories cascading over her.</p>\n<p>\"No way.\" She turned around slowly, staring at him, \"No\u2026 No\u2026 No way are you in this.\"</p>\n<p>He glared, \"I'm kind of disappointed. This is something you should have seen coming. Where is your head at, girl? You and I\u2026 We went through so much together. I thought you'd recognise the signature. Who else would be crazy enough to pull this stunt?\"</p>\n<p>Suzie glared at him, anger overwhelming her, \"How could you do this? All\u2026 This? Aren't people important?\"</p>\n<p>\"Of course they are!\" He laughed, \"Exactly why I did this. Took out the tank. Took out the people who could develop it.  No one deserves this kind of control over the battlefield. No one should do\u2026 Any of this.\"</p>\n<p>The fear shooting through her belonged. Suzie knew this man, knew his mind. She couldn't deny his involvement\u2026 But she really wished she could. This was worse than Josiah. Worse than\u2026 Anything.</p>\n<p>How could he do this to her?</p>\n<p>John O'Connor.</p>\n<p>Her original supervisor, who retired after the incident with Josiah.</p>\n<p>Oh crap. Crapitty-crap-crap-crap!</p>\n<p>\"What\u2026 What the hell is this?\"</p>\n<p>O'Connor grinned and shrugged, \"I though you of all people could work that one out.\"</p>\n<p>She stood there, frozen in place, her heart beating a million miles an hour, and her head stuck in a continuous loop. She couldn't think anything else.</p>\n<p>Crap. How? Why? God\u2026 Crap, crap, crap!</p>\n<p>O'Connor shook his head sadly and raised the pistol in his hand, and she finally reacted. Her mind switched over into combat mode, and she sprinted forward, her arm shattering the hand that held the gun that might end her life, as his fist struck her chest, breaking bone.</p>\n<p>She stumbled backwards, sending the mental command to strengthen her prosthetics, raising her arm barely enough in time to block the knife that appeared in her ex-handler's hand, but not enough to block the left-handed swing that clobbered her in the face.</p>\n<p>She went reeling, crashing to the ground, and O'Connor stood over her, wincing, \"Where's your mind at, Suzie?\"</p>\n<p>Suzie spat onto the ground, wincing at the blood in it, calculating the number of fractures in her jaw, and glared up at him, \"It's hard to figure the mind of the mad. The reasoning they employ is creative, and unduly complicated. This allows them to react in strange and usually unpredictable ways.\"</p>\n<p>She stood slowly as O'Connor smiled at her with humour, \"Come now, is that all you can see?\"</p>\n<p>\"I see fear. I see the anger to extinguish that fear being employed through fear-generating devices.\" Suzie sneered angrily, \"You're nothing but a terrorist, O'Connor.\"</p>\n<p>He sighed heavily, \"I have become what I have, because I must. People like you, people like Josiah, you don't fit the mould of the world. You change it. Burn it. Merely by expressing your thoughts you break the very world you are trying to live inside. The world is not ready for people like you.\"</p>\n<p>Suzie shrugged, \"So I scare the crap out of you. Surprise, surprise. I know you.\" The young girl clenched her fists, \"And if you try and kick me now, like you are thinking of, I will rip the leg from your body. There is no reason in this. No intelligence behind the man that left the agency. You aren't saving this world from any sort of tyranny, you are creating it. Maybe the world isn't ready for people like me\u2026 But it can figure that out on its own.\"</p>\n<p>She clenched her fists, glaring at him, \"I'm not getting out of your way.\"</p>\n<p>\"Fine.\" O'Connor shrugged, and he drew from his left hip, firing quickly, only to find his fingers crushed from a kick, then a fist struck his chest, stumbling him backwards, he barely blocked the knee with his own and then metal fingers were around his throat.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Jeddidiah held up a hand as Manfred went to charge in, the man glaring at the girl on her knees, \"No\u2026 Something's different.\"</p>\n<p>He swallowed nervously, scanning the scene in front of him, \"She's killed someone\u2026 I\u2026 I think I know who that is.\"</p>\n<p>\"Of course it's him!\" Suzie yelled, spinning around to glare at him, \"I thought someone like you could have worked that out by now!\"</p>\n<p>She stood up, storming towards him, tears pouring down her face. Suzie tossed a screen to his feet, \"There's where to find your bloody tank.\"</p>\n<p>Jeddidiah didn't stop her as she walked passed him, rage and grief held within that moment. He could see the man lying dead there, the man he knew could have orchestrated this moment.</p>\n<p>A man who should have never done this.</p>\n<p>How could he have framed his own pupil?</p>\n<p>Jeddidiah winced, he knew the answer, of course.</p>\n<p>That simply made it worse.</p>\n<p>\"Let her go. She's done nothing wrong.\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p>No formal charges were made against John O'Connor.</p>\n<p>However, his grave was never made public.</p>\n<p>Susan Ashley Drakes was presented with the Canadian Victoria Cross by the Governor General of Canada. She subsequently retired from service to the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation, and became engaged to Ted Jameson.</p>\n<p>Jeddidiah Abraham publicly retired as the CEO of McIntyre Industries, and seemingly vanished from the public eye.</p>\n<p>Twenty six agents were killed by the suicide bombings on the CSIS.</p>\n",
